# 📊 ChurnShield: Predictive Analytics for Customer Retention

ChurnShield is an end-to-end machine learning solution designed to help businesses predict and reduce customer churn. Using advanced preprocessing techniques, SMOTE for class imbalance, and a Random Forest model, this project provides actionable insights into customer retention.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project tackles the real-world challenge of predicting customer churn using historical customer interaction data. We apply a structured ML pipeline with the following key stages:

- 📌 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- 🎯 Feature Engineering & One-Hot Encoding
- ⚖️ Resampling via SMOTE to fix class imbalance
- 🌲 Model Training with Random Forest Classifier
- 📈 Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Confusion Matrix
- 📉 Final metrics visualization for business presentation
